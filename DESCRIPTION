Description: We introduce a novel statistical method Linkage-Disequilibrium Eigenvalue Regression for Gene-Environment interactions (LDER-GE). LDER-GE improves the accuracy of estimating the phenotypic variance component explained by genome-wide GE interactions using large-scale biobank association summary statistics.
